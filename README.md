# The Ultimate Collection of Snowden Documents.

This collection serves as a solution to a problem, a problem of availability. The 2013 disclosures of mass surveillance and the disclosures in the following years, have been scattered around the internet in a disorganized fashion since their release. No single source or collection contains every document - this repository serves as a solution to this problem.

Each document is sorted in a folder that is deemed appropriate for its contents and is made searchable to the best of my ability.


NOTE: Not every source is to be taken as one hundred percent factual. These documents are old and have been posted in many different places. Not every source will be accompanied by a direct link. and some documents will not have a source listed at all. I will try my best. Sources will be sorted alphabetically, and are located in `SOURCES.md` in the root of each folder.
